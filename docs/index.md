# Inspire Helsinki 2019 Data Challenges

The four challenges below were selected from the proposals received for the call for challenges. [Sign up](./signup.html) your team to solve one of these challenges during September 2019. The winners are awarded at the [Inspire Helsinki 2019](https://www.inspire-helsinki-2019.fi/) event in October.

The challenge organisers and the partners support the teams with provided data, tools and services to ensure successful results. Those who **sign up by 16 August will benefit the most**. Signing up is possible after that deadline for some time, but the organizers cannot guarantee all perks and discounts for later ones, so please sign up as soon as possible.
