# Inspire Helsinki 2019 Data Challenges

The four challenges below were selected from the proposals received for the call for challenges. [Sign up](./signup.html) your team to solve one of these challenges during September 2019. The winners are awarded at the [Inspire Helsinki 2019](https://www.inspire-helsinki-2019.fi/) event in October.

The challenge organisers and the partners support the teams with provided data, tools and services to ensure successful
results. The hard deadline for the team sign up has been postponed to **Sun 8 September**. Please note that since the challenge
work starts already on 1 September, the later a team signs up, the less of the offered benefits and support can be guaranteed.

See the [about](/about.html) and [awards & rules](/rules.html) pages for more information.
