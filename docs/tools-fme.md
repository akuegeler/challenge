# FME Platform

One central goal of INSPIRE is to promote data sharing in order to better manage the natural environment, spatial planning and impacts related to human safety and quality of life. The Helsinki Data challenges involve integrating INSPIRE themes with other data sources. As a leading spatial data integration platform, FME makes it easy to combine INSPIRE data with whatever other data sources might be needed to address your chosen challenge - whether it be open standards related, event driven, crowd sourced or proprietary.

[Safe Software](https://www.safe.com/) provides free access to our full range of FME tools for the duration of the INSPIRE Helsinki 2019 Data Challenge to all interested teams. This includes [FME Desktop](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/) and [FME Server](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-server/) licenses and [FME Cloud](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-cloud/) access. Con terra is also providing free licensing for the INSPIRE Solution Pack for FME.

To install FME, first download the appropriate installer, and then request an FME license using the Helsinki Challenge web form link below.
